# Event Driven Applications
## Event Driven Programming
1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
- The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is the events module.
2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
- Is improved code organization, modularity, reusability, and maintainability in event-driven systems.
3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
- Event Driven Programming in the backend using Node.js allows us to handle multiple requests concurrently and efficiently, without blocking the execution, every time you interact with a webpage through itâ€™s user interface, an event is happening. When you click a button a click event is triggered. When you press a key a keydown event is triggered. These events have associated functions that, when triggered, are executed to make a change to the user interface in some way.
