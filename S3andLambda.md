## AWS Lambda Basics

**1. What is AWS Lambda?**

- Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that Lambda supports.

- Scheduled, Cron, Periodical Jobs
- Serverless Website Application
- Say Hello to Amazon Alexa
- Stream Large Data With Kinesis Data Stream and Lambda
- Middleware
- Workflows

## CDN

**1. What is a CDN?**

- A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

**2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?**

- CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are spread out at geographically different locations, caching the contents of the page.

**3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?**

- Employing a CDN doesn’t only speed up the delivery of Internet content, it helps protect your website against certain forms of cyber attacks, such as Denial of Service attacks. It protects against these threats because CDNs allow for the handling of more traffic and withstanding hardware failure better than many origin servers.
