# Trees

**1. What is Trees?**
- It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes, Also it is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. 



**2. What are the common terminology related to trees?**
- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes.
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree.
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree.
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree.
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children.
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

## Traversals

Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First.
- Breadth First.

**3. What are the types of tree data structures؟**

- Binary tree: In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two children linked to it. Some common types of binary trees include full binary trees, complete binary trees, balanced binary trees, and degenerate or pathological binary trees.
- Ternary Tree: A Ternary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as “left”, “mid” and “right”.
- N-ary Tree or Generic Tree: Generic trees are a collection of nodes where each node is a data structure that consists of records and a list of references to its children(duplicate references are not allowed). Unlike the linked list, each node stores the address of multiple nodes.

**4. What is the basic operations of a tree data structure?**
- Create – create a tree in the data structure.
- Insert − Inserts data in a tree.
- Search − Searches specific data in a tree to check whether it is present or not.
- Traversal:
1. Preorder Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in a pre-order manner in the data structure.
2. In order Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in an in-order manner.
3. Post-order Traversal –perform Traveling a tree in a post-order manner.
