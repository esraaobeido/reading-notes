# Data Structures and Algorithms

#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
One of the considerations is the efficiency of the data structure in terms of time complexity and space complexity. 

#### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
Validation  the inputs and ensure they are within the expected range, incorrect inputs can cause unexpected behavior, including infinite recursion.
